Dear User,

welcome to USERS App. It doesn't need installation. The program is available at the [link](https://sergik94.github.io/users-table_smart/).

Next features are implemented:

1. A loader is displayed while loading data.
2. Filter by each category using input fields.
3. The filter starts working 500 ms after the last key press by the user. (The useDebonce hook is used).
4. The user can enter the phone number in any format. The filter works ONLY with numbers.
